## About
This web map is designed to continue the discussion of the concept of the <a href='https://www.cnu.org/publicsquare/2021/02/08/defining-15-minute-city'>15-Minute City</a> and the current operations of the <a href='https://www.ferry.nyc/'>NYC Ferry</a>. Last year, I <a href='https://chc9813.medium.com/the-15-minute-city-in-a-new-york-minute-e3d7ea0a0bda'>wrote and mapped out</a> several neighborhoods across New York City and if they could become viable 15-minute cities and found mixed results.

However, it seems that rider counts have been low in comparison to the NYC MTA system. This map will allow you to see average weekday and weekend rider counts from January to March of 2022 by stop. You can also enter in an address to see if you are within a 15-minute radius of a ferry stop. 

A special thanks to <a href ='https://chriswhong.com/'>Chris Whong</a>, for his guidance and wisdom on this project.
