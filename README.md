## About
This web map is designed to continue the discussion of the concept of the <a href='https://www.cnu.org/publicsquare/2021/02/08/defining-15-minute-city'>15-Minute City</a> and the current operations of the <a href='https://www.ferry.nyc/'>NYC Ferry</a>. Last year, I <a href='https://chc9813.medium.com/the-15-minute-city-in-a-new-york-minute-e3d7ea0a0bda'>wrote and mapped out</a> several neighborhoods across New York City and if they could become viable 15-minute cities and found mixed results.

However, it seems that rider counts have been low in comparison to the NYC MTA system. This map will allow you to see average weekday and weekend rider counts from January to March of 2022 by stop. You can also enter in an address to see if you are within a 15-minute radius of a ferry stop. 

A special thanks to <a href ='https://chriswhong.com/'>Chris Whong</a>, for his guidance and wisdom on this project.

## Methodology 
By using the <a href ='https://traveltime.com/'>TravelTime application</a>, I have created layers to show how far one can walk in fifteen minutes from any current operational NYC Ferry station. All data reflects the walking distance on a weekday at noon, at average walking speeds (3 miles per hour). The Greenpoint Ferry station has been closed since the Summer of 2021 for construction and issues with the landowner. This map was created using HTML, JavaSctript, and CSS, and all code can be accessed via GitHub on the Home page.

This project, submitted in March of 2022, is open to new ideas and other additional data to be shown, if you have any ideas or suggestions, please reach out to me via Twitter, also linked on the Home page.
